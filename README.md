This screensaver is configured for every skin separately since it has to use Fonts defined by the skin!

Skin developers have an option to use script-screensaver-digitalclock-custom.xml in their skins 1080i,720p... folder.
They should provide and maintain that xml file with their skin!
Screensaver will check for skin folders in this order: 1080i,720p, 21x9 16x9, 4x3Hirez.
If no script-screensaver-digitalclock-custom.xml is found screensaver will look for an appropriate xml file within screensavers folder.
If there is no appropriate xml file it will use skin.default.xml

If the skin is not on the list screensaver will use default font names from confluence (It might not look pretty but it will work with any skin):

- Aeon Nox 5
- Aeon MQ5
- Aeon MQ6
- Amber (Works, we're just waiting for the skin update)

If your skin is not on the list, and you would like it to be - send me a message.

I have tested this screensaver with a couple of languages and on two systems, windows 7 laptop and Raspberry Pi 2 running Openelec.

Possible issues:
Depending on your language and selected date format the date text might become ... that means that the text for the date is too long, I can fix that easily, just let me know if it happens. (Screenshot would be great including which language you are using and how many letters are supposed to be on the screen).

Everything else should work just fine, let me know if you encounter any bugs or issues.
